# Chrome Apps Forever site

## Why does this repo exist?

Chrome Apps Forever is a web site setup to store chrome apps for those on a device that isn't a chromebook. Maybe when Google sees this repo/site getting some attention they'll at least keep the ability to install chrome apps in chrome. Maybe even under a flag. An app can be created to help users install chrome apps, sort of like how [Chrome Dev Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromedeveditor) does it (this of course will still need Google to allow chrome app installation)
