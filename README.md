# Chrome Apps Forever site

## Why does this repo exist

Chrome Apps Forever is a web site setup to store chrome apps for those on a device that isn't a chromebook. Maybe when Google sees this repo/site getting some attention they'll at least keep the ability to install chrome apps in chrome. Maybe even under a flag. And, of course this site will act as the chrome apps store, until a better alternative comes along. We will definitely need an app that can install chrome apps, sort of like how [Chrome Dev Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromedeveditor) does it. But yes, if you think chrome apps are worth saving then please help as much as you can.
