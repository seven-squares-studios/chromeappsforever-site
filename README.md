# Chrome Apps Forever site

## Why does this repo exist?

Chrome Apps Forever is a web site setup to store chrome apps for those on a device that isn't a chromebook. Maybe when Google sees this repo/site getting some attention they'll at least keep the ability to install chrome apps in chrome. Maybe even under a flag. An app can be created to help users install chrome apps, sort of like how [Chrome Dev Editor](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromedeveditor) does it (this of course will still need Google to allow chrome app installation)

## How can I help?

Well anyone can contribute to this repo/site by:

- Polishing up the site's design
- Uploading a chrome app to the site
- [Bothering Google and Google chrome's twitter by clicking this bullet point](https://twitter.com/share?url=[post-url]&text=[post-title]&via=[via]&hashtags=[hashtags])

## Why on Earth do you care, Kitanga?

I personally like and use chrome apps. I started coding in JavaScript on a chromebook using a chrome app known as Caret. I later used the Chrome Dev Editor to create a simple shmup like game to test out the chrome app APIs and use the localhost functionality to test out [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io) prototypes. When I moved to Windows 10 (because my chromebook had battery issues), I used Web Server for Chrome, which is a very simple to use app that sets up a local server on your machine.

The point I'm trying to make is that chrome apps have a place for some of us, and I frankly feel sad that no one is fighting to keep chrome apps alive. And so I created this repo, for anyone who wants to prove to Google that there are people out here willing to fight to keep chrome apps alive. Anyone can help by:
